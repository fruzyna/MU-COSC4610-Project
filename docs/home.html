  <div id="title">Our Project</div>
  The goal of this project is to determine if there are any connections between local liquor
sales and the socioeconomic status of a county in Iowa. Our focuses for this project is to see if
there is a correlation between a county's income and the amount, count, and cost of alcohol
purchases in that county. We also want to look at popularity and density of stores within the
counties. We will evaluate our conclusions by comparing similar counties to each other and
looking for consistent patterns as well as comparing our results to those found in our research.<br>

  <div id="title">Data Sets</div>
We are currently planning on using two data sets. The first is the Iowa Liquor Sales set.
This is a dataset of all individual spirits purchases in the state of Iowa from 2012 to present (for
some reason it only appears to be 2013 through 2015). This is a very large data set with over 13
million entries. Each entry contains 24 attributes including the purchase data, information
about the store, and a description of the purchase including name, costs, size, and count.<br>
Our second data set is the US Census Bureau's SAIP Iowa County Estimates for 2016 
We are interested in this data primarily because it provides estimated median income by
county for all states including Iowa. It also includes information about children and families in
poverty which could also be a useful factor in our progress.
