# Merging in forks and branches
Python notebooks don't work very well with git. Please refer [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18734739/using-ipython-notebooks-under-version-control/25765194#25765194) to setup Jupyter to automatically save a .py version.

Alternatively, you could save it manually via: File > Download as > Python (.py)

# Converting back to a python notebook
Simply run the included convert-to-notebook.py to convert liquor.py to a .ipynb, modify for any new notebooks.
