Neighborhood Poverty and Alcohol Use  

http://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/25680578.pdf : The Relationship Between Neighborhood Poverty and Alcohol Use: Estimation by Marginal Structural Models by Cerda, Diez-Roux, et. Al. 

    Concludes neighborhood poverty is a predictor of alcohol consumption 

    Most studies donâ€™t account for neighborhood change over time 

    Is it the influence of the neighborhood or the selection of people 

    Individual status affects neighborhood choice and consumption 

    But also product of opportunities in neighborhood 

    Estimated 3 models, traditional repeated measures regression between neighborhood poverty and alcohol risk 

    People in more impoverished neighborhoods were more likely to binge

    Test if there are more alcohol outlets are in areas with high alcohol demand 

    Test if there are less alcohol outlets in areas with high land and structured rends 

    Used data from 2010 National Drug Strategy Household Survey for alcohol demand and census data from Melbourne, Australia 

    Used Bayesian conditional autoregressive Poisson models to estimate the count of bars, restaurants, and off-premise outlets as well as market potential, income and zoning ordinances 

    Found concentration of outlets in low-income areas and fewer concentration in high-income areas 

http://0-search.ebscohost.com.libus.csd.mu.edu/login.aspx?direct=true&db=buh&AN=113304886&site=eds-live Is there a link between alcohol consumption and the level of poverty?
